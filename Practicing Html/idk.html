        <p>The fritters, the missiles, the humans
            All gathered in secrecy
            And flying high as a kite
            Hmm-hmm
            Just know what this about
            Hmm-hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm
            Palm trees, oceans, fresh air that can break your heart
            Hmm-hmm
            Stop tryna be God
            Hmm-hmm, hmm-hm
            Hmm-hmm
            Stop tryna be God
            Hmm-hmm
            That's not who you- are
            Hmm-hmm
            Stop tryna be God
            Hmm-hmm
            That's just not your- job
            Hmm-hmm
            Stop tryna be God, God
            Ride for it every night
            Visions and these angles tight
            Truth be told, I never try
            Diamonds are the wife of life
            All three Rollies look alike
            After two you get a hook-up price
            Stripper never worked a nine-to-five
            Delta and I ship it overnight
            Stop tryna be God almighty
            Fuck the money, never leave your people behind, yeah
            It's never love, no matter what you try
            Still can see it comin' downâ€¦</p>
